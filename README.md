# Stock_Analysis
Module 2 - VBA

Overview of Project Purpose - Anaylsis is refining data into a format that is easier to comprehend. It provides clarity and simplification to quickly interpret the meaning and potential use it to impact other data.

Results - I struggled to get the data to populate the "All Stocks Analysis" worksheet but I was able to write code to display pop-up windows with the correct words. This outcome was the opposit of my work through the module so I am not sure what went wrong. If I were able to correctly accomplish this code, it would allow for a simplified snap shot between 2017 and 2018 so the reader coudl quickly determine the better stock options over time. 

Summary - 
1. Once advantage of refactoring code is you are not starting with a blank page. It gives you a starting point to build from. But that can also be a disadvantage as well. Using code that someone else wrote can be confusing and present challenges that require expertise beyond your skills. 
2. These examples are exactly what I dealt with during this challenge. I thought writing code from scratch was hard until I had to refactor existing code.
